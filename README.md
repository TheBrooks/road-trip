Lets plan our next Road Trip!

The purpose of this website is to practice using ReactJS as well as create a single page website that makes use of existing libraries and frameworks.


The use of this web site will be able to:
  - enter destinations and add them to the road trip
  - view, move and delete the destanations in their road trip
  - the current state of the road trip will be visible on a map with lines drawn from point to point

Data will be provided for their road trip including:
  - miles driven
  - hours driven

A user will be able to save their road trip to a backing server by username and at later dates can continue working on previous road trips or create a new road trip entirely
